# CheckersAI
- An AI that plays checkers using mini-max and alpha-beta pruning to compete against a human player.
- Allows the player to choose the depth of the depth-first mini-max search
- Now with neat loading bar!

### Depths (Average time per move)
- 0 - Searches all possible moves for itself (0 seconds)
- 1 - Searches all its moves and all responses (0 seconds)
- 2 - Searches all its moves, all responses, and all its responses to each of those moves (0 seconds)
- 3 - Searches one more depth (2 seconds)
- 4 - You get the gist (5 seconds)
- 5 - I think this level is best to play against (~20 seconds)
- 6 - If you really want to see the computer go (~1 min)
- 7 - If you're really bored (~3 min)
